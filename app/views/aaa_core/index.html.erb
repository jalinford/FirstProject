    But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our 
    founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our 
    individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.  For the American people 
    can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers 
    could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.  
    No single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to 
    equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and 
    research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our 
    shores.  Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, 
    as one nation, and one people.

    <h1>Excerpt from the end of Obama's Inaugural Address</h1>
    <p>
      Let each of us now embrace, with solemn duty and awesome joy, 
      what is our lasting birthright.  With common effort and common 
      purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of 
      history, and carry into an uncertain future that precious light 
      of freedom.

      “Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait 
      for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the 
      change that we seek.” <br>― Barack Obama
